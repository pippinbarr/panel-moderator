Based on something I saw Aymeric Mansoux do for a panel. A way to bring up prompts for discussion without a moderator. In this case it's items from Claudia Molinari's Mindful Game Design Manifesto.

In essence it does a "wheel of fortune" spin through items from the manifesto, eventually landing on one for the panel to talk through.
